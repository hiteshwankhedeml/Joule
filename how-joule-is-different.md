# How Joule is different

1. Native to SAP Eco system: Directly build in SAP BTP&#x20;
2. Business process enabled ⇒ Not just chat, other chatbots are just for text but Joule is Transaction + Analytical + Decision support
3. Joule is cross application ⇒ We can switch from HR to finance to anything in ecosystem
4. Embedded AI recommendations ⇒ Supplier recommendations, attrition etc.
5. Joule uses domain specific AI along with hybrid LLM
6. Security: Data always resides in tenent
7. Extensibility with SAP Build ⇒ Developers can add extensions
8. It knows the user profile so it will give relevant data ⇒ If a HR guy asks finance data, then it wont answer
