* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Cloud Foundry is a platform to deploy applications without managing servers**</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**It runs apps in containers and handles scaling, routing, and restarts**</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**It is like Kubernetes in that both run containerized applications**</mark>
* <mark style="color:purple;background-color:purple;">**Difference: Cloud Foundry hides infrastructure details, Kubernetes gives low-level control**</mark>
